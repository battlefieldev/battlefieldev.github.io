        <p>
            Below is an honestly produced, series of facts relayed as a story of our ERP software implementation failure both Battlefield International Inc. and OptiProERP experienced. 
            The statements in this website are clearly provably supported by email chains between Battlefield International Inc. and OptiProERP along with knowingly recorded conversations 
            during Teams meetings between both parties. We truly wish no harm to OptiProERP, and hopefully like us, they will make positive changes going forward. 
            We have requested OptiProERP senior management advise what in our message they believe is not true and have promised to make changes directly if anything here is false. 
            They have already done this once and we made adjustments to include their valid point the provided us on April 30th 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            We realize revealing this series of events is highly out of character for Battlefield International Inc. So, to Battlefield International Inc’s highly valued Customers 
            and Suppliers, we want to explain why, for the very first time in our history, we would place additional expense and effort looking back, 
            to share this sort of story that reveals failures firstly on our part as well as the mistakes of a single ERP software supplier to us. Our story is true, provable, 
            and <b>in the publics best interest and clearly needed in today’s ERP software world that are riddled with lawsuits with failed implementations.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <i>From the very first introductory conversation with OptiProERP right through until after we had fully paid and believed our system was virtually ready, 
            OptiPro never mentioned the software we ordered would not do any part of what we originally stated we required and was the very reason we needed ERP in the first place. 
            Our new OptiProERP management contact waited until we had fully paid and then let us know what they sold us wouldn’t do the very heart of what we required from the very start. </i>
            <b>Let those last two sentences sink in.</b>

        <h3 style="background-color: yellow;">
            <b><u>Where OptiProERP Failed:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            1. OptiProERP accepted $100,000.00 US Funds from our company.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            2. OptiProERP led us to believe over more than two years our software was being developed with no issues from their side and no mention of us not getting what 
            we required when they were done.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            3. OptiProERP provided us with nothing but kept all of our money
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            4. OptiProERP accepted our PO, Signed Contract, and payments towards an ERP Software System that we required specifically for Scheduling and Production Planning
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            5. OptiProERP claimed for the first time (By Sudi) AFTER all our payments were made that to do what we wanted 
            (that we explained completely in the quoting stage and never changed) was not possible. 
            They then introduced a brand-new term to us stating we needed “finite scheduling” which wasn’t included. 
            This was relayed to us just after they had led us to believe a functioning software system doing what we required was right ready to go and causing us to send our last payment.
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            6. OptiProERP refused (Through Sudi) to provide one contact of either a CNC or Production firm that had used their system as we were hoping to use it without finite scheduling
        </p>
        <p style="background-color: yellow;">
            7. OptiPro dictated early on, what we required to procure in new hardware and network to enable us to run their software 
            and we added up the wages of wasted time which brings our total direct cost and loss from this specific Supplier that supplied nothing: <b><u>$250,846.94 CDN</u></b>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>
            <b><u>Where Battlefield International Inc. Failed:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. We never Googled “SAP ERP Lawsuits” or “OptiProERP Failed Implementation” or “OptiProERP Lawsuits”. 
            Had we done so, we never would have chosen them, simply due to the first SAP search alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. We should have asked for and made sure we received, fully investigated positive references of successful implementations OptiProERP 
            had done previously in similar industries to ours BEFORE our Purchase Order, contract execution, and first payment was made to OptiProERP.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. We never questioned the fine print in their provided agreement before signing it. We work with the Defense sector and there is not one contract 
            that doesn’t include statements in it that we hope would never be executed, and yet we sign them. We have come to learn that we must agree with fine print 
            that includes statements we don’t like baked in, to function as a Defense supplier (as is common practice). 
            To date, we have never had one of those troubling “fine print” statements we agreed to, acted on or enforced since 1997 from any of our customers or suppliers. 
            We do accept however, that when we sign a contract, we must ultimately be willing to meet all contract statements and for it to be fully applied if ever fully enforced, 
            so we did fail there.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. We decided to delay our implementation due to COVID 19. (Although OptiProERP was very good about enabling our pause).
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Our internal Battlefield lead ERP lead contact left our company, and this caused a delay as we put in place his replacement. Optipro also handled this well with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. We sent the last progress payment, not due until full implementation, knowingly before the work from OptiPro had fully reached that point. 
            However, OptiPro led us to believe we were virtually there, and ready to launch our ERP system and we were anxious to get working with. 
            But regardless, this was entirely our fault and we should have known better.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. We upgraded our computer and network hardware based on the requirements of the OptiProERP system. (Had we not done this, we were made aware from OptiPro instructions, that we would not end up with properly functioning ERP software.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>8. We ended up sending $100,000.00 US to OptiProERP</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            9. <b>“Problem Escalation”</b> step. We did not officially take advantage of the “problem escalation” step as spelled out in the OptiProERP agreement. 
            Since we were in communication with a senior OptiPro manager who near the very end of our attempts to “salvage something from our investment” would not provide 
            a single positive outcome reference of a similar CNC or production company to ours, we could no longer begin any official dispute resolution with Optipro. 
            Our ability to go through their official steps of resolution we had agreed to was torpedoed before we could even begin. 
            Besides the flat refusal of OptiProERP to reveal one single positive reporting reference to us after we had fully paid, our OptiPro manager single mindedly stated over 
            and over in emails and over the phone that our requirements included “finite scheduling”, and he explained that was not available with what we had paid for. 
            This term “finite scheduling” was a brand-new term never mentioned while we made our payments, and never explained to us in any meaningful detail after the fact. 
            Since “Production and Scheduling” was the <b><u>only reason,</u></b> we pursued and required an ERP system in the first place, 
            and this term “finite scheduling” excuse OptiProERP used was firmly applied to the heart of what we made clear we required from the outset, 
            it was a stunning surprise lobbed out at the very end of our ERP development. 
            We would have been doing nothing but wasting time to begin any official dispute resolution that would be headed up by this same person. 
            The time frame of these events with this brand-new contact to us in Optipro management was shortly before our key Battlefield ERP Implementation staff had determined 
            we needed to abandon this software entirely. Our staff were also certain we would only be wasting any time pursuing any solution further with this company. 
            Ownership at Battlefield believed the specific OptiPro managerial staff recently assigned to us who provided nothing helpful to us whatsoever, 
            revealed much about this ERP company that was not a partner to be taken on for likely decades of critically important business dealings.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. We did not take advantage of the “mediation” step available by OptiProERP due to point 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            11. We cannot afford to take our lawsuit to OptiProERP, as that fine print now being enforced, states we would need to take any legal claim to them in California.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red;">
            12. <b style="background-color: yellow;">(OptiProERP supplied website story UPDATE through an email received April 30th 2024) </b>
            To ensure this remains a factual story reflecting both sides of this OptiProERP Implementation Failure at Battlefield International and not an OptiProERP review of any kind, 
            we have added this point to our website as was sent to us from OptiproERP in an email. All updates to ensure this remains a true story, 
            reflecting the opinions of OptiProERP will include a font in the color red. 
            We admit to remaining dormant for 5 months after sending what OptiProERP considered “threats” from us back in December of 2023, 
            and then requesting OptiProERP provide us with a formal release agreement through and email sent from us to Sudi at OptiProERP on April 24th, 2024 at 11:28am 
            that requested OptiProERP terminate/nullify our contract agreement entirely and any and all ties between our firms.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red;">
            13. As expected, we did not get any reply from Sudi or anyone else from OptiProERP to this message from us.
        </p>
        <p style="color: red;">
            14. Only after we made OptiProERP aware of this very website, and on that very same day on April 30th at 4:12pm, did OptiProERP begin being uncharacteristically responsive, 
            and another managerial staff member at OptiProERP reply through an email stating they would honor our request to dissolve all ties made with our contract with them 
            through a document they sent for us to sign. They clearly linked <b><u>this very website</u></b> to their willingness to offer a full dissolution contract offer to us 
            and considered this a “prompt reply” on their part that just happened to occur the day they were made aware of this website. 
            They also stated the following in their message to us in that email: “I would also kindly request you remove the website you sent to Sudi today <span style="background-color: yellow;">as it would be in 
            breach of the non-disparagement clause of the document.”</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            15. However, in reviewing the meaning of the word “Disparagement” the terms official legal meaning is as follows: 
            <b>“the publication of <u style="background-color: yellow;">false</u> and injurious statements that are derogatory of another's property, business, or product.” </b>
            This story included in this website is not “False”. We began by listing the areas our own company failed. 
            We would never disparage our own company or any other. Our main points behind this story and website include the following true and provable claims.
        </p>

    <br>
    <div>
        <p>
            If anyone googles “ERP software implementation lawsuits”, it becomes clear “failed ERP implementation” is a shared important concern ravaging the business world presently 
            and seems to be growing and even accelerating in scope. So, this is not a time to businesses like ours to idly lick our wounds and stay safe, proud, and silent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should full reimbursement not happen of <b><u>$250,846.94 CDN,</u></b> this true, provable-in-an-Ontario-Canada-Court message will remain posted.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the very first time we have experienced anything like this as a company since our inception. We pay our bills on time, treat our customers and staff well, and do our best to improve the lives of all of those we encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
            We wish no ill will towards the staff and ownership of OptiProERP, but do hope they do the right thing so we can consider taking this factual statement of “what happened” offline and can all move on.
