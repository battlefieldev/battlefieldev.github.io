            Below is an honestly produced, fully provable (with recorded conversations and emails) experience report (and not a review), <br>
             that includes the strengths and weaknesses of both our company, Battlefield International Inc. and that of OptiProERP as it pertains <br>
             to our painful ERP Software implementation failure. This message comes only from, and is meant for, those readers in the province of Ontario Canada Eh.

        <p>
            When beginning our journey to select and procure an ERP system, we clearly defined our needs to all software brands we were considering.<br>
            We relayed initially and clearly that we required ERP specifically, for production planning and scheduling software.<br>
            We explained what we do, and the fine technical people at OptiProERP we were dealing with won our business and our trust due to their responses to our well-defined needs.<br>
            OptiProERP also had an excellent point of contact staff member that seemed experienced, well spoken, and was very knowledgeable in the field of ERP which was brand new to us.<br>
            There were two ERP software finalists, we were considering, but we landed with OptiProERP due to them being a part of a much larger company called SAP,<br>
            and since our software requirements were both seemingly well understood and it was replayed to us our well defined requirements from the start were related to us as being standard ERP needs from our technical sales contact at OptiProERP.
