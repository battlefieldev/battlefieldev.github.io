            Below is an honestly produced, fully provable (with recorded conversations and emails), experience report (and not a review), 
            that includes the strengths and weaknesses of both our company, Battlefield International Inc. and that of OptiProERP as it pertains to our painful ERP Software implementation failure. 
            This message comes only from, and is meant for, those readers in the province of Ontario Canada Eh.
        </p>
        <p>
            When beginning our journey to select and procure an ERP system, we clearly defined our needs to all software brands we were considering. 
            We relayed initially and clearly that we required ERP specifically, for production planning and scheduling software. 
            We explained what we do, and the fine technical people at OptiProERP we were dealing with won our business and our trust due to their responses to our well-defined needs. 
            OptiProERP also had an excellent point of contact staff member that seemed experienced, well spoken, and was very knowledgeable in the field of ERP which was brand new to us. 
            There were two ERP software finalists we were considering, but we landed with OptiProERP due to three reasons: <br>
            1. Them being a part of a much larger company called SAP, <br>
            2. Since our software requirements were both seemingly well understood and our contact had extensive past experience working at a firm similar to ours. <br>
            3. It was relayed to us, that our well-defined requirements from the start were related to us as being standard ERP needs from our technical sales contact at OptiProERP.

            <b><u>Where we failed:</u></b> Our companies biggest mistakes in sending our Purchase order and deposit to OptiProERP as our chosen partner, are listed below. 
            The failings numbered directly below this text belong to us alone and not to OptiProERP. 
            This numbered list is in no way the fault of OptiProERP:
        </p>

    <div>
        <h3>
            <b><u>OUR (Battlefield International Inc.) FAULT ENTIRELY:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. We never Googled “SAP ERP Lawsuits” or “OptiProERP Lawsuits”. Had we done so, we never would have chosen them, simply due to the first SAP search alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. We should have asked for and made sure we received and fully investigated and uncovered positive references of successful implementations 
            OptiProERP had done previously in similar industries before our first payment was made to OptiProERP.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. We never questioned the fine print in their provided agreement before signing it. I am not sure if they received our deposit 
            before we sent them the signed contract with fine print details of our agreement, but regardless, we do work with the Defense sector and there is not one contract 
            that we fully agree to that doesn’t have statements in it that we hope would never be executed. 
            We have come to learn fine print concerns that must be agreed to, in order to function as a Defense supplier is common practice. 
            So, we do sign contracts and officially agree to accept detail issues of concern to us. 
            To date, we have never had one of those troubling “fine print” statements being acted on or enforced to date since 1997 from any of our customers or suppliers. 
            We do accept however, that when we sign a contract, we must ultimately be willing to accept it if ever fully enforced, and we failed there.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. We decided to delay our implementation due to COVID 19. (Although OptiProERP was very good about enabling our pause).
        </p>
        <p>
            5. We sent the last progress payment, before the work was completed and we did know it wasn’t totally completed, 
            but we were led by OptiProERP to truly believe we were virtually there and ready to launch our new ERP system.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. We upgraded our computer and network hardware based on the requirements of the OptiProERP system. 
            (Had we not have done this, we realized we would not end up with properly functioning ERP software as per OptiProERP’s instructions).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>7. We ended up sending $100,000.00 US to OptiProERP</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            8. We did not take advantage of the “mediation” step available by OptiProERP.
        </p>
        <p>
            9. We cannot afford to take our lawsuit to OptiProERP, as that fine print now being enforced, states we would need to take any legal claim to them in their state.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>
            <b><u>OptiProERP’s FAULT ENTIRELY:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. “Our team expressed to OptiProERP countless times from the very beginning of our ERP software partner search, 
            that we needed a scheduling and production planning system, to allow us to see a timeline of our machines workload. 
            We mentioned that we need to know how long it will take to complete a job, if we schedule it in on a certain day, 
            and we also needed the capability to see when we need to start a job to meet the required end date. 
            We needed to be able to change production priorities and have the effect to our jobs automatically calculated. 
            We as the customer had no idea what the term ‘Finite Scheduling’ was. 
            As the program specialists, OptiProERP’s implementation team should have been able to understand our request and requirements 
            and translate it to the terminology ‘Finite Scheduling’. How we managed to get over a year into working with OptiProERP 
            and constantly expressing our scheduling needs and this term never came up has me very concerned. 
            Any team implementing a software should be able to take the customers’ requirements and convert them into the systems capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Once OptiProERP received our final payment, that was when they began stating our application was not possible for them to do. 
            Without a hint of any issues ever during our entire process with them until that last payment hit their bank. 
            This very fact caused our team to begin to realize we needed to move on. 
            That mediation could no longer hold value for us as we pressed this issue with them hard 
            and OptiProERP remained adamant their position on not being able to provide us what we had stated clearly, 
            we required from the very start was not changing.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. OptiPro’s courteous technical contact was no longer made available to us and was replaced by staff who did not seem willing or able to help us.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. OptiPro’s new manager, who became our contact as the implementation was beginning to seem totally without merit 
            (possibly a relative of an OptiProERP owner or CEO) refused to give us one single reference of either a CNC or production 
            and assembly company that experienced a successful implementation with OptiProERP. 
            This request for one single positive reference was only made by us because our company ownership team wanted to try to work with whatever the software could do 
            and to realize at least some value from our investment.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. One comical note was noted during one session near the final days of working with OptiPro, 
            their staff told our team members that a loading issue at their end that took more than 2:00 minutes was actually “hardly 30 seconds”. 
            It caused all Battlefield staff to laugh quite uncontrollably.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. OptiproERP software implementation requirement of us was to require us to purchase $62,846.94 CDN of computer 
            and network hardware and took $100,000.00 US of our payments without delivering us any product.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. After receiving 100% of our payments totaling $100,000.00 US funds, 
            the remaining OptiProERP contacts communicated in a way with our team members that led them to determine that we needed to totally abandon this ERP implementation. 
            And when our ownership tried to find a way to salvage some functioning software 
            and tried to get one single reference with the sole intent of knowing any CNC or Production company found a way to work with it, 
            so we could do the same, and asked for just one reference from one single satisfied ERP customer, our company was flatly denied. 
            Our ownership then attempted to contact the listed references on the OptiPro website, 
            that they themselves would provide any positive feedback directly of their use and experience with the software, 
            we learned that one these same OptiProERP-posted references, that had glowing reviews on the OptiPro site, was interested in joining us on a class action, 
            should we decide to take legal action. 
            But the effort to get one happy customer of OptiPro talking was never to end up saying “ah ha, OptiPro is terrible”, 
            it was an honest quest to find something positive that would enable our company ownership to both implement the software 
            and to live with whatever the lack of “finite scheduling” capability meant to us. 
            Our president tried through several strongly worded emails to get one positive reference contact details after we were fully paid up 
            and there was not the tiniest possibility this would ever be supplied. 
            A flat refusal, That very fact, to us is strong evidence that this software company is in the business of taking as much money as they can, 
            and not providing anything in return. At Battlefield International Inc., 
            when we have product failures, we run towards the problem and put as much effort as possible to ensure our product does what is required of us. 
            We can provide hundreds of references of customers who are happy with us. 
            We can also include many customer references that had bad and even costly experiences with us, 
            but in those cases, they would also report, we did make it right. Every time. So we expect similar follow through from our suppliers.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>
            Our failed OptiProERP implementation included cost to our firm of a minimum of $50,000.00CDN of our paid wages towards our wasted implementation attempt. 
            We procured and paid for $62,846.94 CDN of new computer hardware specifically and only due to the requirements of the OptiProERP software. 
            And finally, It also cost us $100,000.00 US that was sent to OptiProERP with us getting nothing at all for our money and no refund.
        </p>
        <p>
            If anyone reading this may be interested in a class action lawsuit, feel free to contact us and let us know. 
            We would at least share each of your contacts with each other 
            and may be willing to head this up if the failed implementation damage scope of OptiProERP customer count is great enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want to be clear in stating that I am sure the people of OptiProERP are fine people, 
            like all readers of this message and the writer as well, we all have struggles and challenges in life and need grace from time to time. 
            But there is something very wrong in taking this amount of money and then not returning it or providing the product as initially ordered and fully paid for. 
            I do hope this message either gets OptiProERP “flying right” or saves other new potential OptiProERP customers to dig deep to ensure before sending your first payment, 
            that OptiProERP can and will provide you with a workable ERP soliution. 
            Just as I listed our business mistakes that contributed to this Implementation fail and our loss of funds, 
            in my first itemized list in this site, 
            I am sure that mistakes happen for all company’s and none of us are perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            We should now get reimbursed the costs we incurred for this payment made to OptiProERP in good faith that netted us nothing at all except lessons learned, 
            while OptiPro pocketed $100,000.00 US without supplying us with anything but additional and significant costs. 
            Should full reimbursement not happen, this true, provable-in-an-Ontario-Canada-Court message will remain posted.
        </p>
        <p>
            We wish no ill will towards the staff and ownership of OptiProERP, 
            and do hope they do the right thing so we can take this factual statement of “what happened” offline and can all move on.
