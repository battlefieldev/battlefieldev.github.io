            Did <b>OptiProERP commit Fraud?</b> We are not claiming this quite yet but will let the reader decide after reading our story. 
            Here is the definition of Fraud to get things started:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>Fraud</u> is generally defined as any form of dishonest or deceptive behavior that is intended to result in financial or personal gain for the fraudster, 
                and does harm to the victim.</b>

            Our story is true, provable, with knowingly recorded Teams meetings and email chain evidence, <b>in the publics best interest 
            and clearly needed in today’s ERP software world that is riddled-with lawsuits from failed implementations.</b> 
            OptiProERP senior management has been made aware of this site and been asked to send any corrections required to ensure it is a true story. 
            They have done this one time.

        <p>
            Our evidence to support the public interest of this site can be realized by simply Googling “<b>ERP Implementation failure lawsuit</b>”. 
            Any who try that specific search will soon uncover costly, business damaging failed ERP implementations from any ERP solution providers besides OptiProERP. 
            The brave companies who are willing to share their experiences with the public can only help ERP software firms and their customers.

            Our ERP Story
        </h2>
        <p>
            <i>From the very first introductory conversation with OptiProERP right through until after we had fully paid and believed our system was virtually ready, 
            OptiPro never mentioned the software we ordered would not do any part of what we originally stated we required and was the very reason we needed ERP in the first place. 
            Our new OptiProERP management contact waited until we had fully paid and then let us know what they sold us wouldn’t do the very heart of what we required from the very start. 
            And their contract that we agreed to stated clearly that no refunds would ever be provided for any reason.</i> <b>Let those last three sentences sink in.</b>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>
            <b><u>Where OptiProERP Failed:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. OptiProERP accepted $100,000.00 US Funds from our company.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. OptiProERP led us to believe over more than two years our software was being developed with no issues from their side and no mention of us not getting 
            what we required when they were done.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. OptiProERP provided us with nothing but kept all our money.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. OptiProERP accepted our PO, Signed Contract, and payments towards an ERP Software System that we required specifically for Scheduling and Production Planning
        </p>
        <p>
            5. OptiProERP claimed for the first time (By Sudi) AFTER all our payments were made that to do what we wanted 
            (that we explained completely in the quoting stage and never changed) was not possible. 
            They then introduced a brand-new term to us stating we needed “finite scheduling” which wasn’t included. 
            This was relayed to us just after they had led us to believe a functioning software system doing what we required was right ready to go 
            and causing us to send our last payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. OptiProERP refused (Through Sudi) to provide one contact of either a CNC or Production firm that had used their system as we were hoping to use it without finite scheduling
        </p>
        <p>
            7. OptiPro dictated early on, what we required to procure in new hardware and network to enable us to run their software 
            and we added up the wages of wasted time which brings our total direct cost and loss from this specific Supplier that supplied nothing: 
            <b><u>$250,846.94 CDN</u></b>
        </p>

        <h3>
            <b><u>Where Battlefield International Inc Failed. A public Interest reveal:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. We never Googled “SAP ERP Lawsuits” or “OptiProERP Failed Implementation” or “OptiProERP Lawsuits”. Had we done so, 
            we never would have chosen them, simply due to the first SAP search alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. We should have asked for and made sure we received, fully investigated positive references of successful implementations OptiProERP had done previously 
            in similar industries to ours BEFORE our Purchase Order, contract execution, and first payment was made to OptiProERP.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. We never questioned the fine print in their provided agreement before signing it. We work with the Defense sector 
            and there is not one contract that doesn’t include statements in it that we hope would never be executed, and yet we sign them. 
            We have come to learn that we must agree with fine print that includes statements we don’t like baked in, to function as a Defense supplier (as is common practice). 
            To date, we have never had one of those troubling “fine print” statements we agreed to, acted on or enforced since 1997 from any of our customers or suppliers. 
            We do accept however, that when we sign a contract, we must ultimately be willing to meet all contract statements and for it to be fully applied if ever fully enforced, 
            so we did fail there.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. We decided to delay our implementation due to COVID 19. (Although OptiProERP was very good about enabling our pause).
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Our internal Battlefield lead ERP lead contact left our company, and this caused a delay as we put in place his replacement. Optipro also handled this well with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. We sent the last progress payment, not due until full implementation, knowingly before the work from OptiPro had fully reached that point. 
            However, OptiPro led us to believe we were virtually there, and ready to launch our ERP system and we were anxious to get working with. 
            But regardless, this was entirely our fault and we should have known better.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. We upgraded our computer and network hardware based on the requirements of the OptiProERP system. (Had we not done this, we were made aware from OptiPro instructions, 
            that we would not end up with properly functioning ERP software.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>8. We ended up sending $100,000.00 US to OptiProERP</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            9. <b>“Problem Escalation”</b> step. We did not officially take advantage of the “problem escalation” step as spelled out in the OptiProERP agreement. 
            Since we were in communication with a senior OptiPro manager who near the very end of our attempts to “salvage something from our investment” 
            would not provide a single positive outcome reference of a similar CNC or production company to ours, we could no longer begin any official dispute resolution with Optipro. 
            Our ability to go through their official steps of resolution we had agreed to was torpedoed before we could even begin. 
            Besides the flat refusal of OptiProERP to reveal one single positive reporting reference to us after we had fully paid, 
            our OptiPro manager single mindedly stated over and over in emails and over the phone that our requirements included “finite scheduling”, 
            and he explained that was not available with what we had paid for. 
            This term “finite scheduling” was a brand-new term never mentioned while we made our payments, and never explained to us in any meaningful detail after the fact. 
            Since “Production and Scheduling” was the <b><u>only reason,</u></b> we pursued and required an ERP system in the first place, 
            and this term “finite scheduling” excuse OptiProERP used was firmly applied to the heart of what we made clear we required from the outset, 
            it was a stunning surprise lobbed out at the very end of our ERP development. 
            We would have been doing nothing but wasting time to begin any official dispute resolution that would be headed up by this same person. 
            The time frame of these events with this brand-new contact to us in Optipro management was shortly before our key Battlefield ERP Implementation staff 
            had determined we needed to abandon this software entirely. Our staff were also certain we would only be wasting any time pursuing any solution further with this company. 
            Ownership at Battlefield believed the specific OptiPro managerial staff recently assigned to us who provided nothing helpful to us whatsoever, 
            revealed much about this ERP company that was not a partner to be taken on for likely decades of critically important business dealings.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. We did not take advantage of the “mediation” step available by OptiProERP due to point 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            11. We cannot afford to take our lawsuit to OptiProERP, as that fine print now being enforced, states we would need to take any legal claim to them in California.
        </p>

            OptiProERP supplied website story UPDATE through an email received April 30th 2024
        </h3>
        <p>
            We appreciate our senior management friends at OptiProERP division of SAP, reviewing our site and providing these factual points that keep this website as fair 
            and true as possible. . To ensure this remains a factual story reflecting both sides of this OptiProERP Implementation Failure at Battlefield International 
            and not an OptiProERP review of any kind, we have added this point to our website as was sent to us from OptiproERP in an email. 
            All updates to ensure this remains a true story, reflecting the opinions of OptiProERP will be added 
            and this site updated as we are made aware of factual parts of this story from OptiProERP in favour of their side of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            12. We admit to remaining dormant for 5 months after sending what OptiProERP considered “threats” from us back in December of 2023, 
            and then requesting OptiProERP provide us with a formal release agreement through and email sent from us to Sudi at OptiProERP on April 24th, 2024 at 11:28am 
            that requested OptiProERP terminate/nullify our contract agreement entirely and any and all ties between our firms.
        </p>
        <p>
            13. As expected, we did not get any reply from Sudi or anyone else from OptiProERP to this message from us.
        </p>
        <p>
            14. Only after we made OptiProERP aware of this very website, and on that very same day on April 30th at 4:12pm, did OptiProERP begin being uncharacteristically responsive, 
            and another managerial staff member at OptiProERP reply through an email stating they would honor our request to dissolve all ties made with our contract with them through 
            a document they sent for us to sign. They clearly linked <b><u>this very website</u></b> to their willingness to offer a full dissolution contract offer to us 
            and considered this a “prompt reply” on their part that just happened to occur the day they were made aware of this website. 
            They also stated the following in their message to us in that email: 
            “I would also <b>kindly</b> request you remove the website you sent to Sudi today as it would be in breach of the non-disparagement clause of the document.” 
            Our initial response to this is: 
            <b>“Battlefield would kindly ask OptiProERP to return all money they took from us while providing nothing”.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            15. However, in reviewing the meaning of the word “Disparagement” the terms official legal meaning is as follows: 
            <b>“the publication of <u style="background-color: yellow;">false</u> and injurious statements that are derogatory of another's property, business, or product.” </b>
            This story included in this website is not “False”. We began by listing the areas our own company failed. 
            We would never disparage our own company or any other.

            This is the very first time we have experienced anything like this as a company since our inception. 
            We pay our bills on time, treat our customers and staff well, and do our best to improve the lives of all of those we encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
            We wish no ill will towards the staff and ownership of OptiProERP, 
            but do hope they do the right thing so we can consider taking this factual statement of “what happened” offline and can all move on.
