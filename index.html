            OptiProERP implementation failure experience
        </h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Below is an honestly produced, series of facts relayed as a story of our ERP software implementation failure both Battlefield International Inc. and OptiProERP experienced. 
            The statements in this website are clearly provably supported by email chains between Battlefield International Inc. and 
            OptiProERP along with knowingly recorded conversations during Teams meetings between both parties. We truly wish no harm to OptiProERP, and hopefully like us, 
            they will make positive changes going forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            We realize revealing this series of events is highly out of character for Battlefield International Inc. 
            So, to Battlefield International Inc’s highly valued Customers and Suppliers, we want to explain why, for the very first time in our history, 
            we would place additional expense and effort looking back, to share this sort of story that reveals failures firstly on our part as well as the mistakes of 
            a single ERP software supplier to us. Our story is true, provable, and <b>clearly needed in today’s ERP software world.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            We hold no anger or malice of any kind towards OptiPro or any of their team members and put this together as a story we believe is important to tell. 
            We know in most cases, OptiPro is not alone to blame whatsoever in involvement in an implementation of ERP software as there are two parties required 
            to perform to land it successfully. There are instances when the customer is solely to blame for the implementation failures, 
            and other times the blame is shared as is the case with us. However, although we do share a part of the responsibility, we do believe in our case, 
            OptiProERP totally failed and the blame falling on their side, is so egregious that they should reimburse us the entire <b><u>$250,846.94 CDN.</u></b> 
            We would appreciate anyone reading this message who cares to provide their opinion of “blame” towards this failure to send us a message as we value all opinions and comments. 
            Maybe you want to share your ERP implementation failure as well with us and that’s fine too.
        </p>
        <p>
            If anyone googles “ERP software implementation lawsuits”, it becomes clear “failed ERP implementation” is a shared important concern ravaging the business world presently and 
            seems to be growing and even accelerating in scope. So, this is not a time for businesses like ours to idly lick our wounds and stay safe, proud, and silent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likely, due to the fine print in each ERP contract being slanted dramatically towards the benefit of the software companies, 
            and with most offering similar contract statements in their favor, the ERP software suppliers have begun to learn they have found a way to extract 
            large sums of money from businesses without any need to provide a working ERP program. 
            Their fine print ensures they are never at risk when considering how they all structure their mediation, 
            and the cost to pursue legal recourse makes it not quite worth it to their business customers, and they know that. 
            This doesn’t mean that the software companies never deliver. But they have obviously discovered, they don’t <b>need</b> to supply software at all to get their initial contract paid. 
            It now usually matters not whether an ERP system is successful as far as getting their initial negotiated pricing paid. 
            And there is no recourse for the customer should most of the blame for the failure rest with the software supplier. 
            So, many software companies (not just OptiPro) have all found a great way to ensure they get paid whether an implementation is successful 
            or not for any reason with no incentive to care. We at Battlefield International Inc. chose to do our part and put effort into slowing this issue 
            and pressing all ERP software brands to abandon their profits gained through ERP systems never delivered in cases where their software supplier bears 
            a large portion of the blame. And we chose to share our true and uncomfortable story openly in Canada with the Battlefield International Inc. / OptiProERP failure. 
            We all need to share our ERP failure stories to assist in helping press this entire ERP software industry sector to make changes to improve the odds of success. 
            ERP programs are critically needed in today’s paperless society in 2024 and on. This is an actual experience report (and not a review) in the form of a story. 
            This message was written from, and is meant only for, anyone in the province of Ontario Canada.

            Battlefield is a multimillion-dollar Aerospace and Defense designer and manufacturer. Our business model includes rapidly working towards dominating our market sector 
            and we are considered by all our customers as being highly responsive and being very service oriented. 
            We have a long-term track record of remaining loyal to our supplier partners and believe that holds tremendous value for Battlefield, our suppliers, and our customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            After we make, own, and solve our mistakes, we try to waste little time focusing on our rearview mirror but as quickly as possible, 
            remain vigilant in continuing to concentrate on pushing forward our business model through altered lenses to ensure similar mistakes are not made. 
            “Lessons learned” that cause an adjustment to policy, has baked in significant health benefits to all companies. So why post this story that reveals our failures as well?
        </p>
        <p>
            We believe this embarrassing event must be shared with others and deserved a pause and the time, effort 
            and required focus from us as it will hopefully enable Battlefield International Inc. , 
            OptiproERP and any other company’s reading this to reduce ERP and possibly other software procurement based missteps going forward. 
            Just as Canada and the USA both believe in and practice freedom of speech, this story is our exercise in our free speech, and as stated before, 
            we have been painstakingly careful to make sure every point made in this story is factual and for each complaint directed at OptiProERP and Battlefield, 
            that we have hard evidence to support every critical statement here.
        </p>
        <p>
            When beginning our journey to select and procure an ERP system, we clearly defined our needs to all software brands we were considering. 
            Battlefield relayed initially and clearly that we required ERP specifically, for production planning and scheduling software. 
            We explained what we do, and the fine technical people at OptiProERP we were dealing with won our business and our trust due to their responses to our well-defined needs. 
            OptiProERP also had an excellent point of contact staff member that seemed experienced, well spoken, 
            and was very knowledgeable in the field of ERP which was a brand-new software to us. There were two ERP software finalists we were considering, 
            but we landed with OptiProERP due to three reasons: 
            <p>
                1. OptiPro being a part of a much larger software giant company called SAP. 
            </p>
            <p>
                2. Our software requirements were well understood by this software firm, and our OptiPro contact had extensive experience working many years in a similar business to ours 
                and had been a tool and die maker. 
            </p>
            <p>
                3. It was alluded to us right from the start <b>in a mutually agreed recorded conversation,</b> by our assigned and experienced technical ERP implementation lead 
                at OptiPro, that our well-defined ERP requirements were standard, and no concerns of complexity in our system, 
                or in OptiPro’s ability to provide software that met our needs was given. From the very first introductory conversation with OptiProERP right through until 
                after we had fully paid and believed our system was virtually ready, OptiPro never mentioned the software we ordered wouldn’t do what we originally stated we required 
                and was the very reason we needed ERP in the first place. Our new OptiProERP management contact waited until we had fully paid 
                and then let us know what they sold us wouldn’t do the very heart of what we required from the very start. <b>Let those last two sentences sink in.</b>
            </p>
            
        </p>
        
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            <b><u>Where we failed:</u></b> 
            Our company’s biggest mistakes before sending our Purchase order and deposit to OptiProERP, and after we began working with them, are listed below. 
            The numbered points from 1-11 directly below this text include failures we at Battlefield International Inc management made:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>
            <b><u>OUR (Battlefield International Inc.) FAULT:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. We never Googled “SAP ERP Lawsuits” or “OptiProERP Failed Implementation” or “OptiProERP Lawsuits”. Had we done so, we never would have chosen them, 
            simply due to the first SAP search alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. We should have asked for and made sure we received, fully investigated positive references of successful implementations OptiProERP had done previously 
            in similar industries to ours BEFORE our Purchase Order, contract execution, and first payment was made to OptiProERP.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. We never questioned the fine print in their provided agreement before signing it. We work with the Defense sector 
            and there is not one contract that doesn’t include statements in it that we hope would never be executed, and yet we sign them. 
            We have come to learn that we must agree with fine print that includes statements we don’t like baked in, to function as a Defense supplier (as is common practice). 
            To date, we have never had one of those troubling “fine print” statements we agreed to, acted on or enforced since 1997 from any of our customers or suppliers. 
            We do accept however, that when we sign a contract, we must ultimately be willing to meet all contract statements and for it to be fully applied if ever fully enforced, 
            so we did fail there
        </p>
        <p>
            4. We decided to delay our implementation due to COVID 19. (Although OptiProERP was very good about enabling our pause).
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Our internal Battlefield lead ERP lead contact left our company, and this caused a delay as we put in place his replacement. Optipro also handled this well with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. We sent the last progress payment, not due until full implementation, knowingly before the work from OptiPro had fully reached that point. 
            However, OptiPro led us to believe we were virtually there, and ready to launch our ERP system and we were anxious to get working with. 
            But regardless, this was entirely our fault and we should have known better.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. We upgraded our computer and network hardware based on the requirements of the OptiProERP system. 
            (Had we not done this, we were made aware from OptiPro instructions, that we would not end up with properly functioning ERP software.)
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>8. We ended up sending $100,000.00 US to OptiProERP</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            9. <b>“Problem Escalation”</b> step. We did not officially take advantage of the “problem escalation” step as spelled out in the OptiProERP agreement. 
            Since we were in communication with a senior OptiPro manager who near the very end of our attempts to “salvage something from our investment” would not provide a 
            single positive outcome reference of a similar CNC or production company to ours, we could no longer begin any official dispute resolution with Optipro. 
            Our ability to go through their official steps of resolution we had agreed to was torpedoed before we could even begin. 
            Besides the flat refusal of OptiProERP to reveal one single positive reporting reference to us after we had fully paid, 
            our OptiPro manager single mindedly stated over and over in emails and over the phone that our requirements included “finite scheduling”, 
            and he explained that was not available with what we had paid for. This term “finite scheduling” was a brand-new term never mentioned while we made our payments, 
            and never explained to us in any meaningful detail after the fact. Since “Production and Scheduling” was the only reason, 
            we pursued and required an ERP system in the first place, and this term “finite scheduling” excuse OptiProERP used was firmly applied to the heart of what we made clear 
            we required from the outset, it was a stunning surprise lobbed out at the very end of our ERP development. 
            We would have been doing nothing but wasting time to begin any official dispute resolution that would be headed up by this same person. 
            The time frame of these events with this brand-new contact to us in Optipro management was shortly before our key Battlefield ERP Implementation staff had determined 
            we needed to abandon this software entirely. Our staff were also certain we would only be wasting any time pursuing any solution further with this company. 
            Ownership at Battlefield believed the specific OptiPro managerial staff recently assigned to us who provided nothing helpful to us whatsoever, 
            revealed much about this ERP company that was not a partner to be taken on for likely decades of critically important business dealings.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. We did not take advantage of the “mediation” step available by OptiProERP due to point 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            11. We cannot afford to take our lawsuit to OptiProERP, as that fine print now being enforced, states we would need to take any legal claim to them in California.
        </p>
        <div style="color: red;">
            <p>
                12. <b>(OptiProERP supplied website story UPDATE through an email received April 30th 2024)</b> 
                To ensure this remains a factual story reflecting both sides of this OptiProERP Implementation Failure at Battlefield International and not an OptiProERP review of any kind, 
                we have added this point to our website. All updates to ensure this remains a true story, reflecting the opinions of OptiProERP will include a font in the color <u>red</u>. 
                We admit to remaining dormant for 5 months after sending what OptiProERP considered “threats” from us back in December of 2023, 
                and then requesting OptiProERP provide us with a formal release agreement through and email sent from us to Sudi at OptiProERP on April 24th, 2024 at 11:28am that 
                requested OptiProERP terminate/nullify our contract agreement entirely and any and all ties between our firms.
            </p>
            <p>
            As expected, we did not get any reply from Sudi or anyone else from OptiProERP to this message from us.
            </p>
            <p>
                Only after we made OptiProERP aware of this very website, and on that very same day on April 30th at 4:12pm, did OptiProERP begin being uncharacteristically responsive, 
                and another managerial staff member at OptiProERP reply through an email stating they would honor our request to dissolve all ties made with our contract with them through a 
                document they sent for us to sign. They clearly linked <b><u>this very website</u></b> to their willingness to offer a full dissolution contract offer to us and considered this 
                a “prompt reply” on their part that just happened to occur the day they were made aware of this website. They also stated the following in their message to us in that email: 
                “I would also kindly request you remove the website you sent to Sudi today as it would be in breach of the non-disparagement clause of the document.”
            </p>
            <p>
                However, in reviewing the meaning of the word “Disparagement” the terms official legal meaning is as follows: 
                <b>“the publication of <u style="background-color: yellow;">false</u> and injurious statements that are derogatory of another's property, business, or product.” </b>
                This story included in this website is not “False”. We began by listing the areas our own company failed. We would never disparage our own company or any other. 
                Our main points behind this story and website include the following true and provable claims.
            </p>
            <p>
                1. That from the very start of our discussions regarding our need for an ERP system, we had relayed clearly to OptiProERP that the very reason we wanted 
                a system was for “scheduling and production planning”.
            </p>
            <p>
                2. That all our fine contacts, experts, and implementation staff at OptiProERP never stated there would be any issues with what we required at any time 
                as the scheduling and production planning was increasingly defined through emails and through knowingly recorded emails which OptiProERP also have in their files. 
                We expected the software we were paying for incrementally would do what we required it to and at the price quoted by OptiProERP and was fully paid for by us.
            </p>
            <p>
                3. After receiving our full $100,000.00 US, Sudi from OptiProERP contacted us and told us our Scheduling and Production Planning needs included “Finite Scheduling” 
                and was not included in what they sold us. This was the very first time we had ever heard this term “Finite Scheduling” from anyone at OptiProERP. 
                It seemed like they may be able to do this for us, but alluded to the fact it would cost more and was quite complicated and much more involved than what 
                they were planning on providing us.
            </p>
            <p>
                4. Sudi at OptiProERP then refused to provide one single reference of another customer that had a similar business to ours that had found a way to work with their 
                system without Finite Scheduling. We wanted one reference only so we could gain some value for our $100,000.00 US investment.
            </p>
            <p>
                5. That our full implementation team here at Battlefield approached our ownership to state that they believed we needed to just abandon this ERP system 
                and look for a new one. We claim that the truth and facts in these statements 1 to 8 are provable through emails and knowingly recorded Teams meetings that both 
                Battlefield International Inc. and OptiProERP have.
            </p>
            <p>
                6. We promise to update this website to ensure it remains fully factual if OptiProERP can prove anything here is not true, it will be addressed directly. 
                Just as we are doing presently (5/1/2024)
            </p>
            <p>
                7. OptiProERP ended up with $100,000.00 USD of our funds and we received no product from them whatsoever and their fine print included mention 
                that funds paid would never be returned.
            </p>
            <p>
                8. So OptiProERP got $100,000.00 USD of our money and we got nothing whatsoever from them in the form of software and they will not refund us.
            </p>
            <p>
                OptiProERP’s opinion regarding the term Disparagement is stated below and does not include the fact that the first part of the legal term for disparagement includes 
                the fact that everything stated must be “false” to meet that words meaning. If this description of the term disparagement by OptiPro directly below is legally true, 
                than we have disparaged both our own company and OptiProERP’s as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><u>OptiPro’s definition of Disparagement:</u></b> Disparagement with regards to our agreement is to publish statements that portray OptiProERP in a negative light, 
                and has little to do with whether or not they can be proven to be true or false. You are free to request a refund at nauseam, 
                but your “story” is about much more than just that. I will refrain from pointing out the areas of your letter that are highly subjective or simply untrue. 
                I will only suggest that we mutually sign the release agreement and wish each other well on all future endeavors.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b><u>OptiProERP</u></b> should have included in their fine print that “Disparagement” needed to include the fact that for their purposes, 
                it could be considered breached in cases where statements were “true”. They did not include this in their fine print. 
                So, it is only fair to link the full legal meaning of this word to what Battlefield International Inc. agreed to. 
                We did not and will not “disparage” as defined legally and will update this website continually to ensure truth as OptiProERP has already enabled us to do here now. 
                Any untrue point here will be immediately removed or adjusted to be made true directly once any “untruth” in this site can be proven so by our friends at OptiProERP.

        <h3>
            <b><u>OptiProERP’s FAULT:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. “Our team expressed to OptiProERP countless times from the very beginning of our ERP software partner search, 
            that the sole reason we wanted an ERP was that we needed a scheduling and production planning system, to allow us to see a timeline of our machines workload. 
            We mentioned that we need to know how long it will take to complete a job, if we schedule it in on a certain day, 
            and we also needed the capability to see when we need to start a job to meet the required end date. We needed to be able to change production priorities 
            and have the effect to our jobs automatically calculated. We as the customer had no idea what the term ‘Finite Scheduling’ was. 
            As the program specialists, OptiProERP’s implementation team should have been able to understand our request and requirements and translate it to the terminology 
            ‘Finite Scheduling’from the start. How we managed to get over a year into working with OptiProERP and constantly expressing our scheduling needs 
            and this term never came up has us very concerned. Any team implementing a software should be able to take the customers’ requirements 
            and convert them into the systems capabilities or if they know they can’t, they should admit they are not the right partner before accepting the Purchase Order, 
            the downpayment, the signed contract, and all the progress payments through to accepting the very last payment.
        </p>

            2. Once OptiProERP received our final payment, that was when they began stating our application was not possible for them to with the software, they sold us. 
            There was never a hint of any software performance issues during our entire process with them supposedly fabricating our ERP software until that last payment hit their bank. 
            This very fact caused our implementation team at Battlefield to begin to realize we needed to move on. 
            That mediation could no longer hold value for us as we pressed this issue with them hard and OptiProERP remained adamant their position on not being able to provide us 
            what we had stated clearly, we required from the very start was not changing.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. OptiPro’s courteous technical contact was no longer made available to us and was replaced by staff who did not seem willing or able to help us.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. OptiPro’s new manager, who became our contact as the implementation was beginning to seem totally without merit (possibly a relative of an OptiProERP owner or CEO) 
            refused to give us one single reference of either a CNC or production and assembly company that experienced a successful implementation with OptiProERP. 
            This request for one single positive reference was only made by us because our company ownership team wanted to try to work with whatever the software could do 
            and to realize at least some value from our investment.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. One comical note was noted during one session near the final days of working with OptiPro, their staff told our team members that a loading issue at their end during 
            a Teams meeting that took more than 2:00 minutes was actually “hardly 30 seconds”.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. OptiproERP software implementation requirement of us to purchase $62,846.94 CDN of computer and network hardware and took $100,000.00 US 
            of our payments without delivering us any product.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. After receiving 100% of our payments totaling $100,000.00 US funds, the remaining OptiProERP contacts communicated in a way with our team members that led them to determine 
            that we needed to totally abandon this ERP implementation. And when our ownership tried to find a way to salvage some functioning software 
            and tried to get one single reference with the sole intent of knowing any CNC or Production company found a way to work with it, so we could do the same, 
            and asked for just one reference from one single satisfied ERP customer, our company was flatly denied. 
            Our ownership then attempted to contact the listed references on the OptiPro website, that they themselves would provide any positive feedback directly of their use 
            and experience with the software, we learned that one these same OptiProERP-posted references, that had glowing reviews on the OptiPro site, 
            was interested in joining us on a class action, should we decide to take legal action. But the effort to get one happy customer of OptiPro talking was never to end up 
            saying “ah ha, OptiPro is terrible”, it was an honest quest to find something positive that would enable our company ownership to both implement the software and 
            to live with whatever the lack of “finite scheduling” capability meant to us. Our president tried through several strongly worded emails to get one positive reference contact 
            details after they were fully paid up and there was not the tiniest possibility this would ever be supplied. A flat refusal. 
            That very fact, to us was strong evidence that this software company was presently in the business of taking as much money from us as they could, 
            while not providing anything in return. At Battlefield International Inc., when we have product failures, 
            we run towards the problem and put as much effort as possible to ensure our product does what is required of it. 
            We can provide hundreds of references of customers who are happy with us. We can also provide lists of many customer references that had bad and even costly experiences with us, 
            but in those cases, they would also report, we did make it right. Every time. We expect similar follow through from our suppliers.

            Our failed OptiProERP implementation included cost to our firm of a minimum of $50,000.00CDN of our paid wages towards our wasted implementation attempt. 
            We procured and paid for $62,846.94 CDN of new computer hardware specifically and only due to the requirements of the OptiProERP software.
            And finally, it also cost us $100,000.00 US that was sent to OptiProERP with us getting nothing at all for our money and no refund. 
            <b>The grand total cost to us directly and only due to our decision to choose Optipro was $250,846.94 CDN.</b> 
            And we also had more direct costs not listed from our local partnering IT provider. 
            We ended up with no product whatsoever and nothing of value from OptiPro except lessons learned. Costly lessons learned.
        </p>

            If anyone reading this may be interested in a <b>class action lawsuit</b>, feel free to contact us and let us know. 
            We already uncovered one other company that was used as a reference on the OptiPro website who wants to get in on a class action against OptiPro. 
            We would at least share your contacts with each other and may be willing to head this up if the failed implementation damage scope of OptiProERP 
            customer count is great enough.

            We want to be clear in stating that we are sure the people of OptiProERP are fine people. Like all readers of this message and the writer as well, 
            we all have struggles and challenges in life and need grace from time to time. But there is something very wrong in taking this amount of money 
            and then not providing the product as initially ordered and fully paid for or returning the funds in full including all of our direct costs. 
            We do hope this message either gets OptiProERP “flying right” or saves other new potential OptiProERP customers to dig deep to ensure before sending your PO 
            and first payment, that OptiProERP can and will provide you with a workable ERP soliution. 
            Just as we listed our business mistakes that contributed to this Implementation fail and our loss of funds, in my first itemized list in this site, 
            we are sure that mistakes happen for all company’s and none of us are perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            We should now get reimbursed the costs we incurred for this payment made to OptiProERP in good faith that netted us nothing at all except lessons learned, 
            while OptiPro pocketed $100,000.00 US without supplying us with absolutely anything but additional and significant costs. 
            Should full reimbursement not happen of <b>$250,846.94 CDN</b>, this true, provable-in-an-Ontario-Canada-Court message will remain posted.

            This is the very first time we have experienced anything like this as a company since our inception. We pay our bills on time, treat our customers and staff well, 
            and do our best to improve the lives of all of those we encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
            We wish no ill will towards the staff and ownership of OptiProERP, but do hope they do the right thing so we can consider taking this factual statement 
            of “what happened” offline and can all move on.
