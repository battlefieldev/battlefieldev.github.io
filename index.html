            OptiProERP implementation failure experience

        <p>
            Below is an honestly produced, fully provable (with recorded conversations and emails), experience report (and not a review), 
            that includes the full story and failures of both our company, Battlefield International Inc. 
            and that of OptiProERP as it pertains to our painful ERP Software implementation failure. 
            This message comes only from, and is meant for, those readers in the province of Ontario Canada
        </p>
        <p>
            When beginning our journey to select and procure an ERP system, we clearly defined our needs to all software brands we were considering. 
            Battlefield relayed initially and clearly that we required ERP specifically, for production planning and scheduling software. 
            We explained what we do, and the fine technical people at OptiProERP we were dealing with won our business 
            and our trust due to their responses to our well-defined needs. OptiProERP also had an excellent point of contact staff member that seemed experienced, 
            well spoken, and was very knowledgeable in the field of ERP which was a brand-new software to us. 
            There were two ERP software finalists we were considering, but we landed with OptiProERP due to three reasons: 
        </p>
        <p>
            1. OptiPro being a part of a much larger company called SAP.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Since our software requirements were well understood by this software firm, 
            and our OptiPro contact had extensive experience working many years in a similar business to ours and had been a tool and die maker.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. It was alluded to us right from the start <b>in a recorded conversation</b>, by our assigned and experienced technical ERP implementation lead at OptiPro, 
            that our well-defined requirements were standard ERP, and no “caution’ was given. Only a positive message of “let’s get going” (in other words).
        </p>

            <b><u>Where we failed:</u></b> Our company’s biggest mistakes before sending our Purchase order and deposit to OptiProERP, 
            and after we began working with them, are listed below. 
            The numbered points from 1-11 directly below this text include failures we at Battlefield International Inc management made:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>
            <b><u>OUR (Battlefield International Inc.) FAULT ENTIRELY:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. We never Googled “SAP ERP Lawsuits” or “OptiProERP Failed Implementation” or “OptiProERP Lawsuits”. 
            Had we done so, we never would have chosen them, simply due to the first SAP search alone.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. We should have asked for and made sure we received, fully investigated positive references of successful implementations OptiProERP 
            had done previously in similar industries to ours BEFORE our Purchase Order, contract execution, and first payment was made to OptiProERP.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. We never questioned the fine print in their provided agreement before signing it. 
            I am not sure if they received our deposit before we sent them the signed contract. 
            But we do work with the Defense sector and there is not one contract that doesn’t include statements in it that we hope would never be executed, 
            and yet we sign them. We have come to learn that we must agree with fine print that includes baked in concerns in our industry to function as a Defense supplier 
            (as is common practice). 
            To date, we have never had one of those troubling “fine print” statements acted on or enforced since 1997 from any of our customers or suppliers. 
            We do accept however, that when we sign a contract, we must ultimately be willing to accept it to be fully applied if ever fully enforced, and we failed there.
        </p>
        <p>
            4. We decided to delay our implementation due to COVID 19. (Although OptiProERP was very good about enabling our pause).
        </p>
        <p>
            5. Our internal Battlefield lead ERP lead contact left our company, and this caused a delay as we put in place his replacement. 
            Optipro also handled this well with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. We sent the last progress payment, not due until full implementation, knowingly before the work from OptiPro had fully reached that point. 
            However, OptiPro led us to believe we were virtually there, and ready to launch our ERP system and we were anxious to get working with. 
            But regardless, this was entirely our fault and we should have known better.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            <b>8. We ended up sending $100,000.00 US to OptiProERP</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            9. “Problem Escalation” step. We did not officially take advantage of the “problem escalation” step as spelled out in the OptiProERP agreement. 
            Since we were in communication with a senior OptiPro manager who near the very end of our attempts to “salvage something from our investment” 
            would not provide a single positive outcome reference of a similar CNC or production company to ours, 
            we could no longer begin any official dispute resolution with Optipro. 
            Our ability to go through their official steps of resolution was torpedoed before we could even begin. 
            Along with the lack of one reference being shared with us, our OptiPro manager single mindedly stated over and over in emails 
            and over the phone that that our requirements included “finite scheduling”, and he explained that was not available with what we had paid for. 
            This term “finite scheduling” was a brand-new term never mentioned or complained about while we made our payments, 
            and never explained to us in any meaningful detail after the fact (see second paragraph in this website). 
            So, we would have been doing nothing but wasting time to begin any official dispute resolution that would be headed up by this same person. 
            The time frame of these events with this brand-new contact to us in Optipro management was shortly before our key Battlefield ERP Implementation staff 
            had determined we needed to abandon this software entirely. 
            Our staff were also certain we would only be wasting any time pursuing any solution further with this company. 
            Ownership at Battlefield believed the specific OptiPro managerial staff recently assigned to us who provided nothing helpful to us whatsoever, 
            revealed much about this ERP company that was not a partner to be taken on for likely decades of critically important business dealings.
        </p>
        <p>
            10. We did not take advantage of the “mediation” step available by OptiProERP due to point 9.
        </p>
        <p>
            11. We cannot afford to take our lawsuit to OptiProERP, as that fine print now being enforced, 
            states we would need to take any legal claim to them in California.
        </p>

        <h3>
            <b><u>OptiProERP’s FAULT ENTIRELY:</u></b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            1. “Our team expressed to OptiProERP countless times from the very beginning of our ERP software partner search, 
            that the sole reason we wanted an ERP was that we needed a scheduling and production planning system, 
            to allow us to see a timeline of our machines workload. We mentioned that we need to know how long it will take to complete a job, 
            if we schedule it in on a certain day, and we also needed the capability to see when we need to start a job to meet the required end date. 
            We needed to be able to change production priorities and have the effect to our jobs automatically calculated. 
            We as the customer had no idea what the term ‘Finite Scheduling’ was. 
            As the program specialists, OptiProERP’s implementation team should have been able to understand our request 
            and requirements and translate it to the terminology ‘Finite Scheduling’. 
            How we managed to get over a year into working with OptiProERP and constantly expressing our scheduling needs 
            and this term never came up has me very concerned. 
            Any team implementing a software should be able to take the customers’ requirements and convert them into the systems capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. Once OptiProERP received our final payment, that was when they began stating our application was not possible for them to do. 
            Without a hint of any issues ever during our entire process with them until that last payment hit their bank. 
            This very fact caused our team to begin to realize we needed to move on. 
            That mediation could no longer hold value for us as we pressed this issue with them hard 
            and OptiProERP remained adamant their position on not being able to provide us what we had stated clearly, 
            we required from the very start was not changing.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. OptiPro’s courteous technical contact was no longer made available to us and was replaced by staff who did not seem willing or able to help us
        </p>
        <p>
            4. OptiPro’s new manager, who became our contact as the implementation was beginning to seem totally without merit 
            (possibly a relative of an OptiProERP owner or CEO) refused to give us one single reference of either a CNC 
            or production and assembly company that experienced a successful implementation with OptiProERP. 
            This request for one single positive reference was only made by us because our company ownership team wanted to try to work with whatever 
            the software could do and to realize at least some value from our investment.
        </p>
        <p>
            5. One comical note was noted during one session near the final days of working with OptiPro, 
            their staff told our team members that a loading issue at their end that took more than 2:00 minutes was actually “hardly 30 seconds”. 
            It caused all Battlefield staff to laugh quite uncontrollably.
        </p>
        <p>
            6. OptiproERP software implementation requirement of us was to require us to purchase $62,846.94 CDN of computer 
            and network hardware and took $100,000.00 US of our payments without delivering us any product.
        </p>
        <p>
            7. After receiving 100% of our payments totaling $100,000.00 US funds, the remaining OptiProERP contacts communicated in a way with our team members 
            that led them to determine that we needed to totally abandon this ERP implementation. 
            And when our ownership tried to find a way to salvage some functioning software 
            and tried to get one single reference with the sole intent of knowing any CNC or Production company found a way to work with it, 
            so we could do the same, and asked for just one reference from one single satisfied ERP customer, 
            our company was flatly denied. Our ownership then attempted to contact the listed references on the OptiPro website, 
            that they themselves would provide any positive feedback directly of their use and experience with the software, 
            we learned that one these same OptiProERP-posted references, that had glowing reviews on the OptiPro site, 
            was interested in joining us on a class action, should we decide to take legal action. 
            But the effort to get one happy customer of OptiPro talking was never to end up saying “ah ha, OptiPro is terrible”, 
            it was an honest quest to find something positive that would enable our company ownership to both implement the software 
            and to live with whatever the lack of “finite scheduling” capability meant to us. 
            Our president tried through several strongly worded emails to get one positive reference contact details after we were fully paid up 
            and there was not the tiniest possibility this would ever be supplied. A flat refusal. 
            That very fact, to us was strong evidence that this software company was in the business of taking as much money from us as they could, 
            while not providing anything in return. At Battlefield International Inc., when we have product failures, 
            we run towards the problem and put as much effort as possible to ensure our product does what is required of it. 
            We can provide hundreds of references of customers who are happy with us. 
            We can also provide lists of many customer references that had bad and even costly experiences with us, but in those cases, 
            they would also report, we did make it right. Every time. We expect similar follow through from our suppliers.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our failed OptiProERP implementation included cost to our firm of a minimum of $50,000.00CDN of our paid wages towards our wasted implementation attempt. 
            We procured and paid for $62,846.94 CDN of new computer hardware specifically and only due to the requirements of the OptiProERP software. 
            And finally, it also cost us $100,000.00 US that was sent to OptiProERP with us getting nothing at all for our money and no refund. 
            <b>The grand total cost to us directly and only due to our decision to choose Optipro was $250,846.94 CDN.</b> 
            And we also had more direct costs not listed from our local partnering IT provider. 
            We ended up with no product whatsoever and nothing of value from OptiPro except lessons learned. Costly lessons learned.
        </p>
        <p>
            If anyone reading this may be interested in a <b>class action lawsuit</b>, feel free to contact us and let us know. 
            We already uncovered one other company that was used as a reference on the OptiPro website who wants to get in on a class action against OptiPro. 
            We would at least share your contacts with each other and may be willing to head this up if the failed implementation damage scope of OptiProERP 
            customer count is great enough.
        </p>
        <p>
            We want to be clear in stating that we are sure the people of OptiProERP are fine people. 
            Like all readers of this message and the writer as well, we all have struggles and challenges in life and need grace from time to time. 
            But there is something very wrong in taking this amount of money and then not providing the product as initially ordered and fully paid for 
            or returning the funds in full. We do hope this message either gets OptiProERP “flying right” or saves other new potential OptiProERP customers 
            to dig deep to ensure before sending your PO and first payment, that OptiProERP can and will provide you with a workable ERP soliution. 
            Just as we listed our business mistakes that contributed to this Implementation fail and our loss of funds, in my first itemized list in this site, 
            we are sure that mistakes happen for all company’s and none of us are perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
            We should now get reimbursed the costs we incurred for this payment made to OptiProERP in good faith that netted us nothing at all except lessons learned, 
            while OptiPro pocketed $100,000.00 US without supplying us with absolutely anything but additional and significant costs. 
            Should full reimbursement not happen of <b><u>$250,846.94 CDN</u></b>, this true, provable-in-an-Ontario-Canada-Court message will remain posted
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the very first time we have experienced anything like this as a company since we began. We pay our bills on time,
             treat our customers and staff well, and do our best to improve the lives of all of those we encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
            We wish no ill will towards the staff and ownership of OptiProERP, and do hope they do the right thing so we can take this factual statement of 
            “what happened” offline and can all move on.
